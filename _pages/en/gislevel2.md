> **_NOTE:_** The [CookBook by Yves on GitHub](https://github.com/yvoirin/cookbook_python3) provides many useful code examples for geomatics professionals. This [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@YvesVoirin) also offers a wealth of resources.

## Shapely: Geometric Operations in Python

**Shapely** is a powerful Python library for manipulating planar geometric objects. It is built on the GEOS library (used by PostGIS) and provides:

- Support for various geometry types: points, lines, polygons, multipoints, etc.
- Geometric operations: intersection, union, difference, distance.
- Geometry attributes: area, length, centroid.
- Seamless integration with libraries like GeoPandas and PyQGIS.

Example: Creating a point and a polygon:

```python
from shapely.geometry import Point, Polygon

# Create a point
point = Point(0, 0)

# Create a polygon
polygon = Polygon([(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 0)])
```

## Rtree: Fast Spatial Indexing

**Rtree** provides spatial indexing and search capabilities using R-tree data structures. It is often used alongside Shapely and GeoPandas for spatial queries.

Key features:

- Nearest neighbor search
- Spatial containment and intersection queries
- Multi-dimensional indexing
- Disk-based storage and fast loading

Example: Finding the nearest object to a point:

```python
from rtree import index

# Create an Rtree index
idx = index.Index()

# Insert points
idx.insert(1, (0, 0, 0, 0))
idx.insert(2, (1, 1, 1, 1))

# Search for the closest point to (1, 1)
results = list(idx.nearest((1, 1, 1, 1), 1))
print(results)
```

## Django & GeoDjango: Web Development with Spatial Support

**Django** is a high-level Python web framework based on the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern. **GeoDjango** extends it to support geographic data and spatial operations.

Core features:

- URL routing and view handling
- ORM for database access and manipulation
- Templating system for dynamic HTML rendering
- Middleware and form validation
- Integration with PostGIS for spatial queries via GeoDjango

## QGIS & PyQGIS: Plugin Development for GIS

**QGIS** is a free and open-source desktop GIS application written in C++. It supports Python through the **PyQGIS** API, allowing developers to build plugins that interact with spatial data.

To build a QGIS plugin:

1. Use Qt Designer to create the plugin interface.
2. Use Plugin Builder to generate the pluginâ€™s structure.
3. Write Python code using the QGIS API to implement functionality.

ðŸ’¡ Tip: Development is accelerated by tools like Plugin Builder, but familiarity with PyQt5 and the QGIS API is essential.
